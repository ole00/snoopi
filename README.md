raiser board for Rpi 40w GPIO connector


![pcb](https://github.com/ole00/snoopi/raw/master/img/snoopi.jpg "snoopi R1")

Here is a basic raiser board for Rpi-like 40w GPIO connector. With Snoopi you can:

- connect an RPi HAT and 'snoop' the traffic on various buses (note
  the extra ground pin for a scope's probe ground connection)
- connect an RPi HAT that has unusual dimensions
- connect an RPi HAT to a host board with a bigger heat sink
- connect a RPi HAT along with an extra SPI or I2C device
- have an easy access to UART port if the HAT does not provide pass-through pins

The PCB design is free and open and can be edited in [Geda PCB CAD tool](http://pcb.geda-project.org)
wich is also free and open source project.

The zipped gerber files for PCB manufacturing can be found in the 'gerbers'
directory.
